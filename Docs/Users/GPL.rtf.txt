Why are we using an RTF file vs.  Src\Copying?  
	The text file is poorly formatted, ugly, and doesn't look as cool in the installer.  

Where did I get the text?
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

How did I change it?
I removed all target hyperlinks(hyperlinks that scroll to different points in the same document).  Therefore their removal doesn't void the legal or literal functionality of the license.  I also lowered the font sizes to 12/10 and Arial for readability.  This font selection was also to match the sizes used in Read Me.rtf also used in the installer.  Once I had made these changes to the HTML content I copied and pasted it from MS Word to Wordpad knowing that wordpad would use less markup (19KB vs. 31KB).  

How Can I translate it?
Well you probably don't have to just go to http://www.gnu.org/licenses/translations.html and create an RTF version of your language.  Please be sure to make the 100% arial.  Remove all hyperlinks replacing them with plain text "Description HTTP://SomeURL.net".  The other thing is headings are bold size 12 and regular text is plain size 10.
