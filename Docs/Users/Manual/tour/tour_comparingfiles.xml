  <title>Comparing Files</title>

  <para>When you compare two files, WinMerge shows the differences between their
  lines. To demonstrate comparing and merging files, consider these two small
  text files named <filename>File1</filename> and
  <filename>File2</filename>:</para>

  <formalpara>
    <title>File1:</title>

    <para><screen>You can cage a swallow,
can't you? 
But you can't swallow 
a cage, can you?</screen></para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
    <title>File2:</title>

    <para><screen>You can cage a swallow.
But you can't swallow 
a cage. Can you?</screen></para>
  </formalpara>

  <section>
    <title>The File Compare window</title>

    <para>If you <link linkend="tour_sel_targets">launch a WinMerge compare
    operation</link> on two files, the File Compare window opens. This screen
    shot compares our two sample files:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="screenshots/filecompwin_tr.png" />
      </imageobject>

      <textobject>
        <phrase>Compare Files screen shot</phrase>
      </textobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The File Compare window makes it easy to see differences between lines
    in your files. It also has special functions for merging different lines
    from one file to the other, and basic editing capabilities for more detailed
    merging within lines. Notice these basic features of the File Compare
    window:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In the bottom right corner of the window, the status bar tells you
        how many differences WinMerge detects.</para>

        <para>The Location pane indicates where the differences are located in
        the files. The Location pane is helpful for working with long files,
        where you can't see all the differences at once in the File
        panes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Differences are marked in the File panes by a gold background
        color. In this comparison, the first difference is a block of two lines;
        the second difference is a single line at the end.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Notice that the first difference has an extra blank line on the
        right side. Why does this blank line appear, since it doesn't exist in
        the source file?</para>

        <para>The empty line is a placeholder in WinMerge that does not change
        the source file. WinMerge inserts blank lines on one side of a
        difference whenever the other side has more lines. The extra lines,
        marked with a gray background color by default, keep the left and right
        sides vertically aligned for ease of comparison. That is, every
        difference begins on the same line in the File panes, even when they are
        on different lines in the source files. Without this feature, files of
        different lengths would be hard to compare.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The third line is identical in both files, so it has no difference
        color (its background is white).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Within differences, WinMerge highlights the text that makes the
        lines different. By default, different words are highlighted. To see
        more detail you can highlight changes at the character level; to see
        less, you can turn off all highlighting within lines.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>The WinMerge main window can contain multiple File Compare (and
      Folder compare) windows. Each File Compare window displays the result of a
      single comparison, representing the two files in the left and right File
      panes. In our screen shot, the File Compare window is maximized within the
      main window:</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Navigating line differences</title>

    <para>In the File Compare window you can use standard mouse and cursor
    actions to select and edit text in either File pane. But in WinMerge,
    working with text and working with differences are not the same thing.
    WinMerge provides special functions to navigate differences.</para>

    <para>For example, click anywhere in an area that is marked as a difference,
    then click the <inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata contentdepth="15" fileref="screenshots/currentdiff_btn_tr.png" />
        </imageobject>

        <textobject>
          <phrase>Current Difference button</phrase>
        </textobject>
      </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Current Difference</guibutton> button in
    the toolbar.</para>

    <para>The next two screen shots show the first difference in our sample
    comparison, after it's selected. When you select a difference, several
    things happen:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Selected Difference background color (red by default)
        highlights the difference in the File panes. The Location Pane also
        highlights the selected difference and marks its location with arrows.
        :</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="screenshots/filecomp_diffpanesel_tr.png" />
          </imageobject>

          <textobject>
            <phrase>Difference selected in Compare Files panes</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The selected difference is loaded in the Diff pane, where you can
        examine it in isolation from other differences.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="screenshots/filecomp_diffpane_tr.png" />

            <phrase>Compare Files Diff Pane</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>All the merge buttons in the toolbar are enabled:
        <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="screenshots/mergebtns_on_tr.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </inlinemediaobject></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The status bar confirms which difference is selected.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Merging differences in files</title>

    <para>You can merge differences at two levels in the File Compare
    window:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Line-level differences</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>As we have seen, a difference includes one or more lines. Use
          the WinMerge merge functions to copy an entire selected difference
          from one side to the other. For example, click the <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata contentdepth="15"
                           fileref="screenshots/copyr_adv_btn_tr.png" />
              </imageobject>

              <textobject>
                <phrase>Copy Right and Advance button</phrase>
              </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Copy Right and Advance</guibutton>
          button.</para>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="screenshots/filecomp_merged_tr.png" />
            </imageobject>

            <textobject>
              <phrase>Compare Files window after merge</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>

          <para>Notice the changes:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The first difference is gone: the lines are now identical
              and have no difference color.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>WinMerge automatically selects the next difference, skipping
              over the identical line. The Location Pane also moves its
              indicator.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The status bar indicates that only one difference
              remains.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>You can see that the navigation and merge functions provide a
          good way to systematically step through all the differences in a
          comparison.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Differences within lines</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Instead of merging entire differences using the Merge functions,
          you can change text within them by manually editing either file
          directly in the File Compare window. For example, if you don't want to
          use either side of the first difference, you can delete the line. Or,
          you might replace <quote>words</quote> on the right side with
          <quote>text</quote>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>After you finish merging, you can click <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> to save changes to both sides. Or, to save just one side,
    click <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save Left</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> or <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.</para>

    <para>This was a trivial example â€” there were only two differences and we
    only merged one of them. But you can use the methods shown here to navigate
    and merge line differences between files of any length.</para>

    <!--
  <para>When you launch a file compare operation, WinMerge opens the File
  Compare window. The window features two columns representing the
  <quote>left</quote> and <quote>right</quote> files that you are comparing, and
  indicates whether the corresponding lines on each side are identical or
  different. WinMerge can also highlight the content within lines that makes
  them different.</para>

  <para>You can tailor how differences are detected and displayed. For example,
  if whitespace differences are not meaningful to your comparison, you can
  choose to ignore whitespace or different line ending encodings. You can change
  the colors used to highlight line differences and the text within them.</para>

  <para>The Compare window has special functions that make it easy to step
  through line differences quickly and systematically, and functions to merge
  differences from one file to the other if you want to. You can also edit the
  files directly in the Compare window.</para>
