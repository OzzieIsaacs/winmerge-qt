    <abstract>
      <para>WinMerge is an Open Source differencing and merging tool for
      Windows. Use it to detect changes between files and folders, and then to
      merge changes selectively. You can use WinMerge by itself, or launch it
      from a version control system or another application.</para>

      <para>When you compare two files or folders, the result is displayed in
      the WinMerge window. The WinMerge window's visual display and functions
      are designed to help you see differences between your targets, and to
      merge selected differences if you want to.</para>

        <title>In a file comparison</title>

        file formats.</para>

      <para>Take this brief, guided tour if you are considering installing
      WinMerge, or if you just want to see what the tool looks like and what you
      can do with it. The topics below describe the main WinMerge features. They
      include some simple examples of comparing files and folders, and merging
      differences between them.</para>

      <para>This tour just scratches the surface. For detailed information and
      guidance about using WinMerge, see the Help that is installed with
      WinMerge and available <ulink url="http://manual.winmerge.org/">on
