  <title>Comparing Folders</title>

  <para>In addition to comparing files in WinMerge, you can compare the contents
  of folders. WinMerge shows which files are different, and provides functions
  to merge files between folders.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The Folder Compare window</title>

    <para>If you <link linkend="tour_sel_targets">launch a WinMerge compare
    operation</link> on two folders, the Folder Compare window opens:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="screenshots/foldercomp_tr.png" format="PNG" />
      </imageobject>

      <textobject>
        <phrase>Folder Compare window</phrase>
      </textobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The Folder Compare window lists the files and subfolders found in the
    target folders. Each row compares a file or subfolder in the two selected
    folder targets. As with the File Compare window, the targets are represented
    on <quote>left</quote> and <quote>right</quote> sides.</para>

    <para>These columns tells you whether corresponding right and left items in
    each row are identical, different, or exist on only one side. The asterisk
    in either the left or right date highlights the more recent date. The icons
    in the Filename column provide visual cues for each type of file, like text
    or binary files, and how the two sides are different. Icons are also used to
    mark files and folders that are found only on one side.</para>

    <para>The columns are sortable. By default, rows are sorted by filename in
    descending alphabetical order. Click the Filename column title to reverse
    the sorting. Or, maybe you're only interested in rows that are different. If
    so, click the Comparison result column title to sort by result type. This
    groups different files together so they're easy to see.</para>

    <para>If you want to display more information, a simple customization lets
    you add additional columns, including file creation time, file encoding
    type, file size, and even the number of differences found.</para>

    <para>The Folder Compare window supports common operations on files, like
    editing, copying, deleting, moving, and renaming (moving is equivalent to a
    copy operation followed by a delete). You can use these file operations and
    WinMerge functions to merge the contents of folders. You can also open files
    using associated programs or external editors. You can even launch file
    compare operations on individual files from the Folder Compare
    window.</para>

    <para>The <inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata contentwidth="23"
                     fileref="screenshots/nav_uparrow_btn_tr.png" />
        </imageobject>

        </textobject>
      </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>up arrow</guibutton> button at the top of
    the Filename column navigates to the parent folder of each target.</para>

    <para>As we mentioned earlier, the WinMerge main window can contain multiple
    Folder Compare or File Compare windows, and each Compare window displays the
    result of a single comparison. In the preceding screen shot, the File
    Compare window is maximized within the main window:</para>

    <title>Navigating folder differences</title>

    <para>To navigate differences at the folder level:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Use conventional keyboard and mouse actions to move between rows.
        To select a difference, simply click its row.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Use the Difference buttons in the toolbar to select differences
        systematically. For example, click the <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentdepth="15"
                         fileref="screenshots/nextdiff_btn_tr.png" />
            </imageobject>

            <textobject>
              <phrase>Next Difference button</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Next Difference</guibutton> button in
        the toolbar (or press <keycombo>
            <keycap>Alt</keycap>

            <keycap>Enter</keycap>
          </keycombo>) to select the next row that is different, automatically
        skipping identical rows.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Comparing subfolders</title>

    <para>So far we have looked at a non-recursive comparison, which includes
    files only in the root of the two folders you select, not any subfolders
    that they contain. To compare their subfolders, you have to launch a new
    compare operation. For example, in the preceding comparison, double-click
    the <filename>Common</filename> folder icon to open a new File Compare
    window that compares the two <filename>Common</filename> folders.</para>

    <para>WinMerge can also compare folders recursively. A recursive comparison
    includes all the files in all subfolders, so you don't need to launch
    separate compare operations to navigate nested folders. </para>

    <para>For targets with many nested folders and files, a recursive comparison
    can can take longer than a non-recursive comparison, and the result can be
    harder to read. In this case, consider displaying the results of recursive
    comparisons in a hierachical tree view instead of the default tabular view.
    Folders are initially collapsed for a compact, readable display â€” expand
    just the ones whose contents you want to see:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="screenshots/treeview_tr.png" format="PNG" />
      </imageobject>

      <textobject>
        <phrase>Folder Compare window</phrase>
      </textobject>
    </mediaobject>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Merging folder differences</title>

    <para>Merging in the Folder Compare window involves either copying items
    (files or folders) between folders, or deleting items.</para>

    <para>For example, suppose you want to synchronize two folders. In the
    preceding screen shot, you can tell from the asterisk that the left version
    of <filename>AboutDlg.h</filename> is more recent. So, to merge
    <filename>AboutDlg.h</filename> select the row and click the
    <inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata contentwidth="17" fileref="screenshots/copyr_button_tr.png" />
        </imageobject>

        <textobject>
          <phrase>Copy Right button</phrase>
        </textobject>
      </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Copy Right</guibutton> button in the
    toolbar.</para>

    <para>When you merge a file or folder, the value in the <guilabel>Comparison
    result</guilabel> column changes to <literal>Identical</literal>.</para>

    <para>Of course, you might not always want to merge entire files or folders.
    For example, you might want to merge selected differences within the files,
    or to examine the differences within files before merging them. In such
    cases, you can double-click a file to launch a file comparison. WinMerge
    displays the result in a new File Compare window, where you can see and
    merge the line-level differences.</para>
